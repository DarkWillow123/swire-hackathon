		"question": "Imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: 'I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.' What would your response be?",
		"answer": "I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns.
