Good morning Jane! How are you doing today?

What was the reason for leaving your previous job at The Ritz-Carlton New-York? And how do you think your experience as a Front Desk Agent there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a Volunteer at Red Cross France. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

This guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from France. As you speak French, could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?
