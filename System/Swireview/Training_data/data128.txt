Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at The [Ritz Carlton, Hong Kong]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a Front Desk Manager at The Ritz Carlton, Hong Kong has taught me how to provide exceptional customer service, manage a team, and handle various guest concerns and complaints. These skills will definitely be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [President] at [National University of Singapore, Hospitality and Tourism Society]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As the president of the society, I learned the value of teamwork and collaboration. Swire Hotels' values of excellence and teamwork are essential in providing exceptional service to guests, and I believe my experience aligns with these values.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire Hotels is giving and is about to check out. You happen to meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from Indonesia, and you speak Indonesian. Could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Selamat sore, terima kasih atas kunjungan Anda di Swire Hotels. Kami senang dapat memberikan pengalaman yang luar biasa untuk Anda selama Anda tinggal di sini. Semoga Anda memiliki perjalanan yang aman dan nyaman pulang ke Indonesia. Sampai jumpa lagi!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Jane]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
