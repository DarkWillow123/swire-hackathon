Interviewer: Good morning [Sophie]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [The DoubleTree by Hilton]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job because I was seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a Front Desk Manager at the DoubleTree by Hilton taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Language Exchange Program] at [Osaka, Japan]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: During my time as a Language Exchange Program participant in Osaka, Japan, I learned the value of cultural competency and empathy towards people from different backgrounds. This aligns with Swire Hotels' values of respect and inclusivity in providing exceptional service to guests from all around the world.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire hotels is giving and now he is about to check out of the hotel where you meet him again in the front desk. When you talk to him, he happens to be from [France]. As you mentioned that one of the languages that you speak is [French], try giving a few short sentences before his departure, expressing your gratitude for him in picking Swire's hotels.

Applicant: Ohayoo! Swire Hotels de no go daizaichuu ni otetsudai dekita koto o ureshiku omoimasu. SubarashÄ« taiken o teikyoo dekita koto o ureshiku omoimasu. Mata o ai dekiru koto o tanoshiminishiteimasu. Doomo arigatoogozaimasu!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Sophie]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
