Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [The Peninsula Beverly Hills - California]? And how do you think your experience as a [Rooms Division Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at The Peninsula Beverly Hills to seek new opportunities that would challenge me and help me grow my career. My experience as a Rooms Division Manager has given me valuable skills in managing a team, handling guest concerns, and maintaining high standards of service. These skills will definitely be beneficial to me in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Hospitality Business Council] at [Cornell University]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a member of the Hospitality Business Council, I learned the value of innovation and creativity in the hospitality industry. Swire Hotels values innovation and creativity in providing exceptional guest experiences, and I believe my experience with the Hospitality Business Council would help me bring new ideas and solutions to the table.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the inconvenience and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Bonjour! Je vous remercie d'avoir choisi Swire Hotels pour votre séjour ici à Hong Kong. Nous sommes ravis d'avoir pu vous offrir une expérience exceptionnelle et j'espère que vous avez passé un séjour agréable avec nous. Merci beaucoup, et au revoir!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Oliver]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
