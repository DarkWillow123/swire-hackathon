Interviewer: Good morning [Emma]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning, thank you for asking. I'm doing well, how about you?

Interviewer: I'm doing great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because I am passionate about providing exceptional customer service and I believe that Swire Hotels, being a luxury hotel company, shares the same values. I also appreciate the company's commitment to sustainability and community involvement.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, your passion for customer service is inspiring. Moving on to the second question, what was the reason for leaving your previous job at [Van Der Valk Hotel]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left Van Der Valk Hotel because I was looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a Front Desk Manager there taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints, manage a team, and maintain high standards of service. These skills will definitely be beneficial in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear, it seems like you possess excellent leadership skills. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Volunteer] at [Amnesty International]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: My time at Amnesty International taught me the value of empathy and understanding towards different perspectives and backgrounds. I believe this aligns with Swire Hotels' values of respect and inclusivity for all guests and employees.

Interivew: Amazing, so you really think empathy is important yeah. Moving on to the next question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would say to him/her sorry for the inconvenience and I would make sure that the problem is resolved before going on.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Sure, Merci d'avoir choisi les hôtels Swire pour votre séjour. Nous attendrons votre prochaine visite dans le futur.

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Emma]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you! You too!
