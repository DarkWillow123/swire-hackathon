Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Marriot Hotels and Resorts]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Agent] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

My experience as a Front Desk Agent there has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. Moving on to the third question, in your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a Language Exchange Program Coordinator at University of Central Asia.

Understanding and communicating with guests from different cultural backgrounds is crucial in providing exceptional service to our guests.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, this guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out.

As you speak [Uzbek], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?
