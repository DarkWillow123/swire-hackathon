Interviewer: Good morning [Matt]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your latest job in [Marriott International]? And how do you think your experience as a previous [Front Desk Manager] there will help you as a front desk manager in Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job to seek new opportunities and challenges that would aid in my professional growth. During my time at Marriott International, I led a team of front desk agents and handled various guest concerns and complaints. I believe this experience would help me significantly in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Hospitality Association Volunteer] at [Harvard University]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a hospitality association volunteer, I learned the importance of attentiveness and empathy towards guests. I believe these values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence and integrity, which are crucial in providing impeccable customer service to our guests.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “ I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and inconvenience caused. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire hotels is giving and now he is about to check out of the hotel where you meet him again at the front desk. When you talk to him, he happens to be from [Hong Kong]. As you speak [Cantonese], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him in choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?
