Interviewer: Good morning [Aminata]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Hilton Worldwide, Accra, Ghana]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job in search of new challenges and opportunities for career growth. My experience as a Front Desk Manager at Hilton Worldwide has provided me with an understanding of how to handle various guest concerns and complaints efficiently and professionally. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurricular activities was being a [Volunteer] at [Red Cross Society, Ghana]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a member of the African Tourism Board, I learned the importance of collaboration and teamwork in achieving common goals. These values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence, integrity, and teamwork, which are essential elements in providing exceptional service to our guests.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire hotels is giving and now he is about to check out the hotel where you meet him again in the front desk. When you talk to him, he happens to be from [Kenya]. As you mentioned that one of the languages that you speak is [Swahili], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him in picking Swire's hotels?

Applicant: Habari! Nashukuru kwa kuchagua Swire Hotels kwa kukaa yako hapa Hong Kong. Tuna furaha sana kuwa tuliweza kutoa uzoefu bora wakati wako na tunatarajia kukuona tena wakati mwingine. Asante sana na safari salama!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today, [Aminata]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
