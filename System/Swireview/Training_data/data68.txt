I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.
