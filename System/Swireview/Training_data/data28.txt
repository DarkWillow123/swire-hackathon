Interviewer: I'm doing great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it is a luxury hotel company with an excellent reputation for exceptional customer service. I am passionate about hospitality and I believe I could grow my career with Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: Thank you, that's very interesting. Moving on to the second question, could you tell us the reason for leaving your previous job at [Hilton Hotels]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Agent] there will help you in your role as Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left Hilton Hotels to explore new opportunities for professional growth. My previous experience as a Front Desk Agent at Hilton taught me how to manage various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and timely manner. I believe this experience will be valuable in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned being a [Volunteer] at [Red Crescent Society]. Could you tell us about one of the values you learned from that experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer at Red Crescent Society, I learned the value of empathy and compassion. Swire Hotels' values of integrity, teamwork, and excellence are aligned with this lesson. Understanding the needs and requests of our guests and going above and beyond in their satisfaction is essential for exceptional customer service.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk, and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would sincerely apologize for the guest's wait time and their dissatisfaction with our service. I would take their information, investigate the matter, and find a solution that could satisfy the guest's request while adhering to Swire Hotels' policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing. Finally, imagine the same guest is now very satisfied with the services at Swire Hotels and is checking out from the front desk. You meet him again and learn that he is from [Iran]. As you speak [Persian], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Salam! Khili khoshhalam ke shoma be Swire Hotels arezooye khod ra por kardid. Ma shoma ra behtarin negahdari kardim va omidvaram ke be zoodiy shoma ra dobare bembinim. Motashakkeram! Goodbye!

Interviewer: Thank you very much for your time, [Nasim]. We will be in touch with you soon regarding the next steps. Have a good day!
