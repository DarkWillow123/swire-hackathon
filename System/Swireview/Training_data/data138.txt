Interviewer: Good morning [Leila]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry, and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Four Seasons Hotel, Beirut]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job to explore new opportunities and challenges, and I believe my experience as a Front Desk Supervisor will benefit me in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels. I learned how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner, and I am confident that I can apply this knowledge to Swire Hotels' high standards of service.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Regional Ambassador] at [Hospitality Club at AUB]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a Regional Ambassador, I learned the value of effective communication and how it can positively impact team performance. This aligns with Swire Hotels' values of teamwork and collaboration, essential elements in providing exceptional customer service.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “ I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire hotels is giving and now he is about to check out of the hotel where you meet him again at the front desk. You learn that he is from [Lebanon]. As you speak [Arabic], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?
