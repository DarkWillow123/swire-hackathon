Interviewer: Good morning [Lana]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your latest job in [The Peninsula Hong Kong]? And how do you think your experience as a previous [Guest Relations Officer] there will help you as a front desk manager in Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job in a hotel because I was looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a Guest Relations Officer has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. So it seems that you are looking for new challenges. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurricular activities was being a [Vice President] at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hotel and Tourism Society]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As the [Vice President] of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hotel and Tourism Society], I learned the value of teamwork and collaboration. I believe these values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence, integrity, and teamwork. Working together as a team is crucial in providing exceptional service to our guests.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: "I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service." What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet her again at the front desk and learn that she is from [Germany]. As you speak [German], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for her choosing Swire Hotels before she departs?

Applicant: Hallo! Es war uns eine Freude, Sie bei uns in den Swire Hotels zu haben, und wir freuen uns, dass wir Ihnen ein außergewöhnliches Erlebnis bieten konnten. Wir hoffen, Sie bald wieder zu sehen. Vielen Dank, dass Sie sich für Swire Hotels entschieden haben!
