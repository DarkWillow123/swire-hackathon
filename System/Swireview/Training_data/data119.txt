Interviewer: Good morning [Isabella]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm good. Let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it is a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry, and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Starwood Hotels and Resorts]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Starwood Hotels and Resorts because I wanted to work for a company with a stronger focus on luxury and exceptional customer service. My experience as a Front Desk Manager at Starwood taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Event Organizer] at [International House]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As an Event Organizer, I learned the importance of attention to detail and organization. These values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence and integrity, which are essential elements in providing exceptional customer service.

Interivewr: Amazing. Moving on to the next question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, let's say a guest is about to check out and is very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Bonjour! Je suis ravi de savoir que vous avez apprécié votre séjour ici à Swire Hotels. Nous sommes fiers de vous offrir une expérience exceptionnelle et nous espérons vous revoir bientôt. Merci beaucoup!

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. That concludes our interview, [Isabella]. Thank you for your time and answers today. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps.
