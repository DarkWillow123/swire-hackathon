Interviewer: Good morning! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Grand Hyatt Jakarta]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job because I was seeking a new challenge and a better opportunity for my career. My experience as a Front Desk Manager has taught me how to handle various guest inquiries and issues professionally and efficiently. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role here at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that you were a volunteer at [Greenpeace Indonesia]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: During my time at Greenpeace, I learned the importance of sustainability and environmental awareness. Swire Hotels also places a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability, which aligns with my personal values and beliefs.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would start by apologizing to the guest for the inconvenience and frustration caused. I would then ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would meet the guest's needs within the boundaries of the hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that detailed response. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Bonjour! Je tiens à vous remercier d'avoir choisi Swire Hotels pour votre séjour à Hong Kong. Nous sommes heureux que vous ayez apprécié votre expérience avec notre hôtel et notre service exceptionnel. Nous espérons vous revoir bientôt chez Swire Hotels. Merci beaucoup!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you, you too!
