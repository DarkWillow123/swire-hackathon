Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its luxury hotel reputation in Hong Kong that prioritizes providing exceptional customer service. I am passionate about the hospitality industry, and I believe Swire Hotels would be the best place to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the second question, can you tell me the reason for leaving your current job at [Sandals Royal Bahamian Resort & Spa]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

As a Front Desk Supervisor, I learned how to handle various customer concerns and complaints professionally and efficiently. These skills would be beneficial in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. On your CV, you mentioned that you were a Hospitality Student Association Treasurer at the University of the Bahamas. Could you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk, and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would apologize to the guest for the inconvenience and inform him/her that I would rectify the situation as soon as possible. I would investigate the issue and find a solution that upholds Swire Hotels' policies and standards while satisfying the guest's needs.
