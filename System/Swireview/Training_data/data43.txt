Interviewer: Good morning [John]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm doing well, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it is a luxury hotel company that manages several high-end hotels in Hong Kong. I believe that being a front desk manager at Swire Hotels would be an excellent opportunity for me to grow and develop my career in the hospitality industry.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Moving on to the second question, could you tell us why you left your previous job at [Hilton Glasgow]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job because I was looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth. As a Front Desk Supervisor at Hilton Glasgow, I was responsible for managing a team of front desk agents and ensuring the smooth operation of the front desk. I learned how to handle different guest concerns and complaints professionally, which I believe will greatly benefit me as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that you were a Volunteer at [Edinburgh International Festival] as a secretary. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a secretary at Edinburgh International Festival, I learned the value of teamwork and collaboration. I believe these values align with Swire Hotels' values of integrity, excellence, and teamwork. Working together as a team is essential in delivering exceptional service to our guests.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you just arrived as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: Firstly, I would apologize to the guest for the wait time and show empathy towards her situation. I would then assure the guest that I will do everything in my power to resolve the issue promptly. After that, I would ask for her information so that I can investigate the situation and come up with a satisfactory solution that meets both the guest's needs and the hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for your response. Lastly, in the same scenario, suppose the guest is exceptionally happy with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check-out; you meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [Germany]. As you speak [German], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Natürlich! Sehr geehrte Dame/Herr, Es freut mich sehr, dass Sie einen uneingeschränkt zufriedenen Aufenthalt hier in Swire Hotels hatten. Wir sind stolz darauf, unseren Gästen stets die beste Erfahrung zu bieten, und ich bin froh, dass wir Ihre Erwartungen erfüllen konnten. Vielen Dank für Ihre Wahl und auf Wiedersehen!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [John]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you, you too!
