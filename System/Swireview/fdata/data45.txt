Interviewer: Good morning [John]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm doing well, thank you. Let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation for managing luxury hotels in Hong Kong, and its focus on exceptional customer service. I am passionate about the hospitality industry and believe that Swire Hotels could provide me with the ideal platform to develop my career further.

Interviewer: Thank you for your response. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [InterContinental Hotels Group]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you in your role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left InterContinental Hotels Group to seek a new challenge in a different environment. As a Front Desk Supervisor at InterContinental, I have gained a deep understanding of guest service and how to resolve guest complaints effectively.  My experience in managing high-pressure situations and my ability to delegate tasks to my team members will help me excel in my new role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: Thank you for your insight. For the third question, I noticed that you were the [President] of the [Hospitality Student Association, University of Costa Rica]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As the President of the Hospitality Student Association, I learned the importance of teamwork and leadership skills. I believe these skills align with Swire Hotels' values of integrity, excellence, and teamwork. The ability to work successfully within a team towards common goals is crucial in providing exceptional service to the guests.

Interviewer: Thank you, that is a great example. For the next question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: First, I would apologize for the delay and inconvenience. Then, I would ask the guest for their information and investigate the situation to find a resolution that would satisfy the guest's needs, while also upholding the policies and standards of Swire Hotels. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that our guests always feel taken care of and comfortable.

Interviewer: Thank you for your solution. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, imagine that the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You see him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Bonjour! Je voudrais vous remercier d'avoir choisi Swire Hotels pour votre séjour, et j'espère que votre expérience avec nous était exceptionnelle. Je suis heureux d'avoir pu vous aider à rendre votre séjour plus agréable, et je souhaite vous revoir bientôt. Merci beaucoup et bon voyage!

Interviewer: Thank you very much, [John], for your time and insightful answers. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you too, have a great day!
