Interviewer: Good morning [Jung]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Marriott Hotel]? And how do you think your experience as a [Head Receptionist] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Marriott Hotel because I was seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow professionally. As a Head Receptionist, I gained extensive experience in managing and supervising a team, handling guest complaints, and ensuring smooth operations at the front desk. These skills will definitely help me in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Team Leader] at [Asian-American Association]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a Team Leader at the Asian-American Association, I learned the value of diversity and inclusivity. These values align with Swire Hotels' values of respect and integrity towards guests and employees from different cultures and backgrounds. I believe that embracing diversity and creating an inclusive environment is crucial in delivering exceptional customer service.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: "I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service." What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire Hotels is giving and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [Philippines]. As you speak [Filipino], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Magandang araw po! Ako po si Jung, front desk manager dito sa Swire Hotels. Maraming salamat po sa pagpili ninyo sa aming hotel at sa sobrang pagkamalasakit ninyo sa amin, maraming salamat po. Sana po ay nag-enjoy kayo sa inyong pananatili dito sa aming hotel. Hanggang sa muli po!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Jung]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you! You too!
