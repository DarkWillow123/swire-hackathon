Interviewer: Good morning [Niken]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I am doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I am great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it is a reputable luxury hotel company in Hong Kong that values exceptional customer service. I always had a passion for the hospitality industry, and I think that Swire Hotels would provide me with the perfect opportunity to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Jakarta]? And how do you think your experience as a [Guest Services Agent] there will help you in your role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job to expand my skills and knowledge in the industry. My experience as a Guest Services Agent has taught me to be patient, empathetic and attentive when it comes to guest concerns and complaints. These qualities will definitely help me in managing any guest relations issues efficiently and effectively at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that you volunteered at the [[Indonesia]n Red Cross]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer at the Indonesian Red Cross, I learned the value of compassion and empathy. These values align with Swire Hotels' values of providing exceptional customer service by understanding and anticipating guests' needs.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk, and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the inconvenience and assure them that I will do everything I can to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a satisfactory solution that meets not only the guest's needs but also the hotel's standards and policies.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the same scenario, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [Indonesia]. As you speak [Bahasa [Indonesia]], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Selamat pagi! Saya senang bisa membantu Anda selama menginap di Swire Hotels. Kami sangat menghargai kepercayaan Anda dalam memilih hotel kami untuk menginap, dan kami berharap bisa melihat Anda kembali di masa depan. Terima kasih banyak!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Niken]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
