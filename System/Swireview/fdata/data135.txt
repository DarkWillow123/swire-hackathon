Interviewer: Good morning [Fatima]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Four Seasons Hotel]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Four Seasons Hotel because I was looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills. My experience as a Front Desk Manager at Four Seasons taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. Moving on to the third question, in your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a volunteer at Lebanese Red Cross. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer at Lebanese Red Cross, I learned the value of compassion and empathy. I believe these values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence and integrity. Providing exceptional service to our guests requires not only the technical skills but also a genuine care for their needs and concerns.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “ I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Bonjour! Je suis ravie que vous avez apprécié votre séjour ici à Swire Hotels. Nous sommes heureux d'avoir pu vous offrir une expérience inoubliable. Merci d'avoir choisi Swire Hotels pour votre séjour ici à Hong Kong. Au revoir!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Fatima]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you! You too!
