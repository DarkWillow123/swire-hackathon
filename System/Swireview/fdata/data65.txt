Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Plaza Hotel, Moscow]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job to explore new opportunities and expand my skillset. At Plaza Hotel, Moscow, I was responsible for ensuring that guests received an exceptional level of customer service at all times. My experience in managing a high-pressure environment and handling guest complaints with tact and professionalism will be greatly transferable to my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. Moving on to the third question, in your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Hospitality Committee Member] at [Moscow International Film Festival]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a Hospitality Committee Member, I learned the importance of attention to detail and going above and beyond in order to exceed guest expectations. Swire Hotels' values of exceptional customer service and dedication to ensuring that guests have a memorable experience aligns perfectly with the values that I have learned and will allow me to contribute to the company's success.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will personally see to it that their concerns are addressed. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation in order to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?
