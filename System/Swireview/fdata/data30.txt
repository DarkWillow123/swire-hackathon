Applicant: Good afternoon, thank you for having me. I am doing well, how about you?

Interviewer: I'm good, thank you. Let's get started with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a top luxury hotel company, known for providing exceptional customer service. I am passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe that Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that answer. Moving on to the second question, can you tell us about your previous job as a [Front Desk Supervisor] at the [Peninsula Hotel] and how your experience will help you in your role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: My experience as a Front Desk Supervisor at the Peninsula Hotel has taught me how to manage a team, handle high-pressure situations, and provide excellent customer service. I believe that these skills and experiences will add significant value to my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that you were the captain of the university soccer team. Can you tell us about one of the lessons you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a soccer team captain, I learned the value of teamwork and collaboration. I believe these values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence, integrity, and teamwork. Working together as a team is crucial in providing exceptional service to our guests.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would apologize to the guest for the wait time and calmly ask for their personal information so that I can investigate the situation further. I would take the time to listen to their complaints and give them reassurance that the situation would be handled with utmost urgency and professionalism.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire hotels is giving and now he is about to check out the hotel where you meet him again in the front desk. When you talk to him, he happens to be from [China]. As you mentioned that one of the languages that you speak is [Mandarin], try giving a few short sentences before his departure, expressing your gratitude for him in picking Swire's hotels.
