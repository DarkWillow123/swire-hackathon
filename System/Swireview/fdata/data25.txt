Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it is a luxury hotel company that manages many luxury hotels in Hong Kong with a great reputation. I want to work for a company that values exceptional customer service, and Swire Hotels aligns with that.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Hilton Worldwide]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Hilton Worldwide because I have been there for many years, and I was looking for a new opportunity to expand my skills and learn new things. Working as a Front Desk Supervisor provided me with the skills to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe this experience will be valuable in dealing with high-pressure situations as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. SO it seems that you are looking for new challenges. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurricular activities is being a [President] at [Hospitality and Tourism Society, University of West Asia]. Can you tell us more about one of the values that you learned from the position that aligns with Swire Hotel's values?

Interview: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk, and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, if a guest is from [Brazil] and is about to check out, and you happen to speak Portuguese, can you give a farewell message to the guest expressing your gratitude for choosing Swire Hotels?
