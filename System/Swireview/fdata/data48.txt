Interviewer: Good morning [John]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning, I'm doing well, thank you. How about yourself?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry, and I admire the luxury hotel company's reputation for exceptional customer service. I believe that Swire Hotels would give me the opportunity to grow my career and provide me with new and exciting challenges.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your latest job in [The Ritz-Carlton]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you as a front desk manager in Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job in a hotel because I was looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a front desk agent has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: Thank you for your input, [John]. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned being a [Vice-President] at the Student Government Association. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a Vice-President at the Student Government Association, I had the opportunity to develop my communication and collaboration skills, and these values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence, teamwork, and integrity. Working together as a team is key to providing exceptional customer service, and I believe that my experience in leadership positions has provided me with these skills.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, [John]. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and the inconvenience caused. Then, I would listen to the guest's concerns carefully and try to understand their perspective. After that, I would assure them that I would do everything in my power to address their concerns and find a satisfactory solution that upholds Swire Hotels' policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for your thoughtful response, [John]. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, assume the guest is now very satisfied with the service and is about to check out. You meet them again at the front desk and learn that they are from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for choosing Swire Hotels before they depart?

Applicant: Bienvenue en Swire Hotels! Je suis ravie d'avoir pu vous satisfaire pendant votre séjour. Merci beaucoup pour votre visite, et j'espère vous revoir bientôt.

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today, [John]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
