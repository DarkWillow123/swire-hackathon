Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it is a luxury hotel company in Hong Kong that manages many prestigious properties. I have always been drawn to the hospitality industry, and Swire Hotels' reputation for exceptional customer service aligns with my own values and goals.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can definitely see how your values align with Swire Hotels'. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Grand Hyatt - Rio de Janeiro]? And how do you think your experience as an [Assistant Manager] there will help you in your role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Grand Hyatt-Rio de Janeiro to take on new challenges and continue growing in my career. My experience as an Assistant Manager provided me with skills in leadership, communication, and problem-solving, all of which I believe will be essential in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. You mentioned in your CV that you were the [President] of the [University Hospitality Society]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Swire Hotels' core values of integrity, teamwork, and excellence align with my own values and experiences in this regard.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you just happen to arrive, and she says to you, “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and their dissatisfaction with our service. Then, I would assure them that I am here to help and investigate the situation further to find a solution that meets their satisfaction while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, imagine that the same guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet them again at the front desk and learn that they are from [Portugal]. As you speak [Portuguese], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for them choosing Swire Hotels before they depart?
