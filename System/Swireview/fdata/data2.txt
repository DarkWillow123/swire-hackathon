Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Conrad Hong Kong]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Receptionist] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Conrad Hong Kong to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a Front Desk Receptionist has equipped me with essential skills, such as attention to detail, customer service, and problem-solving. I believe that these competencies will help me thrive in the role of front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. SO it seems that you are looking for new challenges. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being an [Event Coordinator] at [Hong Kong University Business Association]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: Well, as an Event Coordinator, I learned the importance of good communication, attention to detail, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, all of which I believe are essential skills for success in the hospitality industry. These values align with Swire Hotel's corporate values of excellence, teamwork, and integrity. By working together as a team, we can provide our guests with a world-class service and memorable experiences.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: "I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service." What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for their wait time and assure them that I understand their frustration. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards. As a front desk manager, I would ensure that my team is well-trained and equipped to handle such situations, so our guests' satisfaction is not compromised.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [China]. As you speak [Mandarin], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Sure, Ni hao! Suibian cong meiguo lai de wode pengyou, wo xiang gaoxing de shuo "xiexie"! (Hello! As my friend who came from America, I would like to say "thank you"! In Mandarin Chinese) I would then proceed to thank him for choosing Swire Hotels as his destination and hope to see him again soon in the near future.

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Mark]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you, have a great day too!
