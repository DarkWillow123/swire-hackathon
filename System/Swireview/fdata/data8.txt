Interviewer: Good morning [Liam]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm doing well, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry, and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. I can sense your enthusiasm for the industry. Moving on to the second question, can you tell me why you left your previous job at [The Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh, Scotland]? And how do you think your experience as a Front Office Assistant there will help you in your role as a [Front Desk Manager] at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job because I was looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a front office assistant has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Volunteer] at [Hands on London, London, England]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer, I learned the value of giving back to the community and helping those in need. I believe this aligns with Swire Hotels' values of sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Providing exceptional service to guests also means making a positive impact on the community and environment around us.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: "I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service." What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that answer. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [Italy]. As you speak [Italian], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Buongiorno! Je suis ravi d'avoir pu vous aider pendant votre séjour ici à Swire Hotels. Nous sommes ravis d'avoir pu vous offrir une expérience exceptionnelle et nous espérons vous revoir bientôt. Grazie mille!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Liam]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you! You too!
