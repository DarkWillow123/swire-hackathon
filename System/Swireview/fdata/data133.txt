Interviewer: Good morning [Maria]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Marina Bay Sands Hotel]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Officer] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Marina Bay Sands Hotel because I was looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a front desk officer has taught me how to provide exceptional customer service, handle various guest concerns and complaints, and work effectively in a team. These skills will definitely help me in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. So, the third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Business Development Analyst] at [NUS Entrepreneurship Society]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a business development analyst, I learned the value of innovation and creativity. I believe these values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence and integrity. Swire Hotels is known for its innovative approach in the hospitality industry, and I'm excited to contribute to that through my role as a front desk manager.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire hotels is giving and now he is about to check out of the hotel where you meet him again in the front desk. When you talk to him, he happens to be from [Indonesia]. As you speak [Bahasa Indonesia], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him in picking Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Tentu saja! Selamat tinggal dan terima kasih telah memilih Swire Hotels sebagai tempat menginap Anda di Hong Kong. Kami senang dapat memberikan pengalaman yang tak terlupakan untuk Anda, dan kami berharap Anda akan kembali ke Swire Hotels di masa depan. Sampai jumpa lagi!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Maria]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
