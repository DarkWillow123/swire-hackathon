Interviewer: Good morning [Samantha]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your latest job in [Mandarin Oriental]? And how do you think your experience as a previous [front desk agent] there will help you as a front desk manager in Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job in a hotel because I was looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a front desk agent has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. So it seems that you are looking for new challenges. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurricular activities is becoming the [president] in [Oak University cheerleader team]. Can you tell us more about one of the values that you learned from the position and how it aligns with Swire Hotel's values?

Applicant: As a president of my university's cheerleader team, I learned the value of teamwork and collaboration. I believe these values align with Swire Hotel's values of excellence, integrity, and teamwork. Working together as a team is crucial in providing exceptional service to our guests.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “ I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire hotels is giving and now he is about to check out of the hotel where you meet him again in the front desk. When you talk to him, he happens to be from [Spain]. As you mentioned that one of the languages that you speak is [Spanish], try giving a few short sentences before his departure, expressing your gratitude for him in picking Swire's hotels.

Applicant: ¡Buenos dias! Me alegro de haber podido ayudarle durante su estancia aquí en Swire Hotels. Estamos encantados de haber podido brindarle una experiencia excepcional y esperamos volver a verle pronto. ¡Muchas gracias!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Samantha]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you! You too!
