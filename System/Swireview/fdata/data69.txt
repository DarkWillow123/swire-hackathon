Interviewer: Good morning [Sergei]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I am doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it is a luxury hotel company that provides exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry, and I believe Swire Hotels would provide me with the perfect opportunity to advance my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Hilton Novosibirsk]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Agent] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left Hilton Novosibirsk because I was seeking new challenges and growth opportunities. As a Front Desk Agent, I learned how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. It also taught me how to manage my time and prioritize tasks, skills that are essential for a Front Desk Manager role.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurriculars. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your hobbies was being a hobby chef at Novosibirsk Culinary Society. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a hobby chef, I learned the importance of attention to detail and precision, as well as the value of being creative in finding new approaches to cooking. These values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence and innovation, which are essential in providing exceptional guest experience.

Interviewer: Excellent, thank you for sharing that. Now onto the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk, and you arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and their inconvenience. Then, I would assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Lastly, I would take their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Lastly, imagine a scenario where a guest is about to check out and is very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels. As you speak [German], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for them choosing Swire Hotels before they depart?

Applicant: Ja, ich spreche Deutsch. Vielen Dank, dass Sie sich für Swire Hotels entschieden haben. Wir freuen uns, dass wir Ihnen eine hervorragende Erfahrung bieten konnten, und hoffen, Sie bald wieder bei uns begrüßen zu dürfen. Auf Wiedersehen!
