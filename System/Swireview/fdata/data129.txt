Interviewer: Good morning [Mariam]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Radisson Blu Hotel Cebu]? And how do you think your experience as a [Guest Relations Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job because I was seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a Guest Relations Manager taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurriculars. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [President] at [Parahyangan Tourism Student Association]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a president of the student association, I learned the value of teamwork and collaboration. I believe these values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence, integrity, and teamwork. Working together as a team is crucial in providing exceptional service to our guests.

Interviewer: Amazing answer, seems you had learned a lot from that student association. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “ I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the final question, imagine a scenario where a guest is about to check out and you meet him again at the front desk. You learn that he is from [France], and as you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Bonjour! Je suis ravi d'avoir pu vous aider pendant votre séjour ici à Swire Hotels. Nous sommes ravis d'avoir pu vous offrir une expérience exceptionnelle et nous espérons vous revoir bientôt. Merci beaucoup!

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Mariam. That's the end of our interview today. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
