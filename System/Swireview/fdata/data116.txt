Interviewer: Good morning [Luke]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I am doing well, thank you for asking. How are you?

Interviewer: I am great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it is a renowned luxury hotel company in Hong Kong that prides itself on delivering exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and feel that Swire Hotels would provide me with the opportunity to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Mandarin Oriental Bangkok]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job because I was seeking new challenges and growth opportunities. My experience as a Front Desk Manager at Mandarin Oriental Bangkok taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner, which I believe will be crucial in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurricular activities was being a [Volunteer] at [Habitat for Humanity, Miami, FL]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer at Habitat for Humanity, I learned the value of teamwork and collaboration in achieving a common goal. These values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence, integrity, and teamwork, which are essential in providing exceptional service to our guests.

Interviewer: Amazing. Now on to the next question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that experience. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire Hotels is giving and is about to check out. When you talk to him, he mentions that he is from [France]. As you mentioned that one of the languages that you speak is [French], could you give a few short sentences before his departure, expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels?

Applicant: Bonjour! Je suis ravi que vous ayez apprécié votre séjour chez Swire Hotels. Nous sommes reconnaissants de votre choix et espérons vous revoir bientôt. Merci beaucoup! 

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Luke]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you! You too!
