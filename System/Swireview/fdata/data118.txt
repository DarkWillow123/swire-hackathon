Interviewer: Good morning [Aiko]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Four Seasons Hotel]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job as a Front Desk Supervisor at Four Seasons Hotel because I was seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience there taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner, which I believe will be valuable in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Student Ambassador] at [University of British Columbia]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a Student Ambassador, I learned the value of excellent communication skills, both verbal and non-verbal, when interacting with guests from different backgrounds. This aligns with Swire Hotels' values of providing exceptional customer service to all guests, regardless of their cultural background.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when he says this to you: “Je suis désolé, mais c'est ridicule. J'ai attendu à la réception pendant plus de 20 minutes maintenant, et j'ai des choses à faire. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi il n'y a pas plus de personnel pour aider les clients comme moi. Je demande un remboursement de mon séjour en raison de ce mauvais service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards. In addition, I would try my best to diffuse the situation by offering a complimentary service or by letting the guest vent their frustrations in a calm and professional manner.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Bonjour! Je suis heureuse d'avoir pu rendre votre séjour ici à Swire Hotels exceptionnel. Nous sommes ravis d'avoir pu répondre à vos besoins et espérons que vous reviendrez bientôt. Merci beaucoup!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Aiko]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you! You too!
