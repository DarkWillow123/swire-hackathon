Interviewer: Good morning [John]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How are you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it is one of the leading luxury hotel companies in Hong Kong that prioritizes exceptional service for its guests. I have a passion for hospitality and I believe that Swire Hotels would be the perfect place for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Moving on to the second question, can you tell us about your reasons for leaving your previous job at the [Marriott Hotels]? How do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job in search of new challenges and opportunities for professional growth. My experience as a Front Desk Manager has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe that these skills will be valuable in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from being a [Event Planner] at [Moscow State University Hospitality Society] and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer at the local charity, I learned the importance of putting the needs of others first and providing excellent service. This aligns with Swire Hotels' values of putting guests first and providing exceptional service.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is upset at the front desk and you happen to arrive while they are expressing their frustration. The guest says, “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for their wait time and express my condolences for the inconvenience caused. I would then take the initiative to listen actively to the specific concerns that the guest raises and provide a practical solution that meets the expectations of the hotel and the guest. At all times, I would remain calm and professional in my tone.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, imagine that this guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You learn that they are from [France], and as you speak [French], can you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for them choosing Swire Hotels before they depart?
