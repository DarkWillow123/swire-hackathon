Interviewer: Good morning [David]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm doing great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it's a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I've always been passionate about the hospitality industry, and I believe Swire Hotels is the perfect place to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Hilton Hotel]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Hilton Hotel to look for new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a Front Desk Manager there has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valued in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that you were a volunteer at [Red Cross Society]. Could you tell us about one of the values that you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer at Red Cross Society, I learned the value of compassion and empathy. I believe these values align with Swire Hotels' values of excellence, integrity, and teamwork. Providing exceptional customer service comes from genuinely caring about our guests and their needs.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk, and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him at the front desk again and learn that he is from [Uzbekistan]. As you speak [Uzbek], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Salom! Swire Hotelsda sizni xizmat qilish imkoniyatimizdan hursandmiz. Bizning mijozlarimizga yordam berish bilan birgalikda, himmat va zamonaviy qulayliklarni yig’ishga qaratilgan vaqtimizdan bahramandmiz. Sizni yana ko‘rishga umid qilamiz. Rahmat!
