Interviewer: Good morning [Anna]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Kempinski Hotel Moscow]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left Kempinski Hotel Moscow as I was looking for a new challenge and an opportunity to grow my career further. My experience as a previous Front Desk Manager has allowed me to develop my management and customer service skills, which will be useful in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Volunteer] at [Russian Red Cross]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer, I learned the value of empathy and compassion towards others. These values align with Swire Hotels' values of exceptional service and care towards their guests.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: To begin with, I would apologize to the guest for the inconvenience caused and assure them that I understand their frustration. I would then ask for their information, investigate the situation, and try to find a solution that meets their needs, while also upholding the hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [Germany]. As you speak [German], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Natürlich! Guten Tag! Ich danke Ihnen für Ihre Wahl von Swire Hotels als ihr Aufenthaltsort und hoffe, dass Sie eine angenehme Erfahrung hatten. Wir freuen uns darauf, Sie bald wieder bei uns begrüßen zu dürfen. Auf Wiedersehen!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Anna]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you! You too!
