Interviewer: Good morning [Sara]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Hilton Hotels and Resorts]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Hilton Hotels and Resorts to seek new challenges and growth opportunities. My experience as a Front Desk Supervisor has taught me how to handle guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Volunteer] at [Oxfam]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer at Oxfam, I learned the value of compassion and empathy towards others. I believe these values align with Swire Hotels' values of integrity and exceptional customer service. Being compassionate and empathetic towards guests is essential in providing a memorable and positive experience during their stay.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: Firstly, I would apologize for the wait time and acknowledge the guest's concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a resolution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding Swire Hotels' policies and standards. I would ensure that the guest feels heard and their concerns are addressed in a timely and professional manner.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [France]. As you speak [French], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Bienvenue en France! Je suis heureuse que vous ayez apprécié votre séjour à Swire Hotels. Nous sommes toujours ravis d'accueillir des invités de différentes parties du monde! Merci beaucoup d'avoir choisi Swire Hotels et au revoir!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and responses today, [Sara]. We will be in touch with you shortly regarding the next steps in the hiring process. Have a great day!
