Interviewer: Good morning [Lisa]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm doing well, thanks. Let's move on to the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because it's a well-respected luxury hotel company with an emphasis on exceptional guest service. I'm passionate about the hospitality industry and believe that Swire Hotels would be the perfect fit to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the second question, what was the reason for leaving your previous job at [Shangri-La Hotel Jakarta]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Shangri-La Hotel Jakarta to find new challenges and opportunities for growth. As a front desk supervisor, I gained extensive experience in handling guest complaints and ensuring that guest needs are met efficiently. I believe this experience will be helpful in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: I see. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Vice President] at [Student Council Hospitality Management, University of [Indonesia]]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a Vice President at Student Council Hospitality Management, University of Indonesia, I learned the importance of teamwork and collaboration in achieving common goals. Swire Hotels' emphasis on teamwork and excellence aligns with this value, and I believe my experience will allow me to contribute positively to the team.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: My first response would be to apologize to the guest for the inconvenience and assure her that we will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. I would then ask for her information and investigate the situation to find a solution that meets her needs while also upholding Swire Hotels' policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario mentioned earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from Indoensia. As you speak Bahasa [Indonesia], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Tentu saja! Selamat tinggal! Terima kasih telah memilih Swire Hotels untuk menginap. Kami senang dapat memberikan pengalaman yang tak terlupakan bagi Anda selama di sini. Kami berharap dapat bertemu lagi di masa depan. Terima kasih banyak!

Interviewer: Thank you for your time and answers today, [Lisa]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
