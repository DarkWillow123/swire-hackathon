Interviewer: Good morning [Matt]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning, I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Hilton Toronto]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Office Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left Hilton Toronto to seek new opportunities for growth and development. My experience as a Front Office Manager has taught me how to manage a team effectively and how to provide exceptional customer service. These skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [volunteer] at [Red Door Shelter]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a volunteer at Red Door Shelter, I learned the value of empathy and compassion. These values align with Swire Hotels' values of exceptional customer service and providing a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere for all guests.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: "I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service." What would be your response?

Applicant: I would apologize to the guest for the wait time, then I would listen attentively to their complaints and try to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire hotels is giving and now he is about to check out of the hotel where you meet him again in the front desk. When you talk to him, he happens to be from the [Philippines]. As you speak [Tagalog], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him in choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?
