Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Address Dubai Marina, Emaar Hospitality Group]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job because I was seeking new opportunities and challenges to grow my career. My experience as a Front Desk Manager there has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a Volunteer at [Special Olympics World Games Abu Dhabi 2019]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Swire Hotels' values of excellence, integrity, and teamwork align with my personal values of inclusivity and diversity. I believe that by embracing these values, I can provide exceptional service to all guests regardless of their background and culture.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing at the front desk and you happen to just come when she says this to you: “ I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?

Applicant: I would apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service that Swire hotels is giving and now he is about to check out of the hotel where you meet him again at the front desk. When you talk to him, he happens to be from [Italy]. As you speak [Italian], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: Buongiorno! Siamo onorati di avervi ospitato qui a Swire Hotels. Grazie per aver scelto di soggiornare con noi e per averci permesso di offrirvi una esperienza indimenticabile. Speriamo di rivedervi presto! Arrivederci!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today [Sara]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!
