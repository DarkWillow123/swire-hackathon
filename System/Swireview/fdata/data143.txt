These skills will be valuable in my role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels in ensuring an exceptional guest experience.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Volunteer] at [Vancouver Food Bank].

I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would be your response?
