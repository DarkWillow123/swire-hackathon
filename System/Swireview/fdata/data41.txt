Interviewer: Good morning [John]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm doing well, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I've always been fascinated by Swire Hotels' reputation as a leading luxury hotel company in Hong Kong that values exceptional customer service. As a highly skilled professional in the hospitality industry, I believe Swire Hotels would offer me the opportunity to build my career and further develop my skills.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the second question, can you tell me about your previous job as a Front Desk Manager at InterContinental Hotels Group? And how do you think your experience there will benefit you at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: My experience at [InterContinental Hotels Group] taught me how to effectively manage a team, handle complaints and resolve conflicts, and provide exceptional service to each and every guest. These skills and knowledge will be highly valuable in my role as a [Front Desk Manager] at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your experience as a Vice President of the Hospitality and Tourism Management Association. Can you tell me about one of the values you learned from that experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As [Vice President] of the [Hospitality and Tourism Management Association], I learned the importance of teamwork and collaboration in achieving common goals. These values highly align with Swire Hotels' values of teamwork and excellence.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, can you imagine a scenario when a guest is arguing with the front desk and happens to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: First and foremost, I would apologize for the guest's wait time and express a genuine willingness to resolve the issue at hand. I would then listen attentively to the guest's concerns, assuring her that her complaint is taken seriously. Lastly, I would offer a solution that would satisfy the guest and maintain the hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, imagine that this guest has had a great experience at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. He turns out to be from France. As you speak French, could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude?

Applicant: Bien sûr! Madame/Monsieur, je suis ravi(e) que vous ayez apprécié votre séjour ici à Swire Hotels. Nous sommes fiers de vous offrir une expérience de qualité supérieure à chaque fois. Nous espérons vous accueillir à nouveau très bientôt en tant qu'invité(e) privilégié(e) de Swire Hotels. Merci beaucoup et au revoir!
