Interviewer: Good morning [Juanita]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Marriott International]? And how do you think your experience as a [Guest Services Manager] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left Marriott International to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a Guest Services Manager has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a prompt and professional manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Volunteer Tutor] at [Children's Home Society]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a Volunteer Tutor at Children's Home Society, I learned the value of compassion and empathy. These values are in line with Swire Hotels' values of providing exceptional service to our guests and ensuring their comfort and satisfaction throughout their stay.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize to the guest for the wait time and assure them that I will do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. Then, I would ask for their information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards.

Interviewer: Thank you for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [Spain]. As you speak [Spanish], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?

Applicant: ¡Buenos días! ¡Muchas gracias por elegir Swire Hotels durante su visita a Hong Kong! Esperamos que haya disfrutado su estancia con nosotros, y nos encantaría volver a verlo en su próximo viaje. ¡Que tenga un buen día!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and answers today, [Juanita]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day!

Applicant: Thank you! You too!
