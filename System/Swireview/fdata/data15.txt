Interviewer: Good afternoon, [Ana]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good afternoon! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm doing great, thank you for asking. Without further ado, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because I've always admired the company's reputation for providing exceptional customer service and its commitment to innovation and sustainability. As a professional in the hospitality industry, I believe Swire Hotels would offer me the perfect opportunity to grow my expertise and develop my career trajectory.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Hotel Fasano]? How do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you in your role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: While I had a great experience working at Hotel Fasano, I felt like I had reached a point where I needed new challenges and opportunities for growth. As a Front Desk Supervisor, I honed my skills in customer service, team management, and problem-solving, all of which will be invaluable in my new role as a Front Desk Manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. The third question is about your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurricular activities was being an [International Student Ambassador] at [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]. Can you tell us about one of the lessons you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As an International Student Ambassador, I learned the value of cultural awareness and sensitivity. I had the opportunity to engage with people from diverse backgrounds and learned to navigate cross-cultural differences with empathy and respect. Swire Hotels' commitment to diversity and inclusivity aligns with these values, and I believe my experience will enable me to foster an environment of cultural respect and understanding among guests and team members.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question - can you imagine a scenario where a guest is very angry at the front desk, and then you arrive just as they are starting to complain? “I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting here for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service.“ What would your response be?

Applicant: I would first apologize for the guest's wait time and express my understanding of their frustration. I would then offer to listen to their complaints while assuring them that I would do everything in my power to resolve their concerns. I would investigate the situation and identify a solution that aligns with the hotel's policies and standards while also meeting the guest's needs.

Interviewer: That's a great approach. Lastly, in the same scenario, what if the guest is now exceptionally satisfied with their experience at Swire Hotels and comes back to the front desk to check-out. It turns out that they're from [France], and you speak [French]. Could you give them a brief farewell message?

Applicant: Bien sûr! Bonjour! Je suis ravi d'avoir pu vous aider pendant votre séjour ici à Swire Hotels. Nous sommes fiers de fournir un service exceptionnel et de créer des expériences inoubliables pour nos clients. Je suis heureux que vous ayez apprécié votre séjour chez nous et que nous ayons pu répondre à vos attentes. Merci beaucoup, et au plaisir de vous revoir bientôt!

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and thoughtful responses today, [Ana]. We will be in touch soon regarding the next steps in the application process.

Applicant: Thank you very much, it was a pleasure to be here. Have a great day!
