Interviewer: Good morning [Chochko]! How are you doing today?

Applicant: Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

Interviewer: I'm great, thank you. So, let's start with the first question. Why did you apply to Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I applied to Swire Hotels because of its reputation as a luxury hotel company that values exceptional customer service. I have always been passionate about the hospitality industry and I believe Swire Hotels would be a great fit for me to grow my career.

Interviewer: Thank you for that, I can really feel your passion there. Moving on to the second question, what was your reason for leaving your previous job at [Maison Fahrenheit Hotel, Lagos]? And how do you think your experience as a [Front Desk Supervisor] there will help you in your role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels?

Applicant: I left my previous job at Maison Fahrenheit Hotel because I was seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. My experience as a Front Desk Supervisor has taught me how to handle various guest concerns and complaints in a professional and efficient manner. I believe these skills will be valuable in my role as a front desk manager at Swire Hotels.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. So it seems that you are looking for new challenges. The third question is regarding your extracurricular activities. In your CV, you mentioned that one of your extracurriculars was being a [Treasurer] at [The African Students Association, University of Lagos]. Can you tell us about one of the values you learned from this experience and how it aligns with Swire Hotels' values?

Applicant: As a treasurer, I learned the value of financial responsibility and accountability. I also learned how to work collaboratively with other members to achieve our goals. These values align with Swire Hotels' values of integrity, teamwork, and excellence. I believe that these essential elements are critical in providing exceptional customer service, which is the cornerstone of Swire Hotels' brand.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the fourth question, imagine a scenario where a guest is arguing with the front desk, and you happen to arrive just as she says this to you: "I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I've been waiting at the front desk for over 20 minutes now, and I have things to do. I don't understand why there aren't more staff members working to help guests like me. I demand a refund for my stay because of this poor service." What would your response be?

Applicant: My first response would be to empathize with the guest and apologize for the inconvenience caused. I would then ask for the guest's information and investigate the situation to find a solution that would satisfy the guest's needs while also upholding our hotel's policies and standards. I would make sure to communicate with the guest each step of the way, to ensure that they are satisfied with the resolution.

Interviewer: Thank you so much for that. Lastly, in the scenario earlier, the guest is now very satisfied with the service at Swire Hotels and is about to check out. You meet him again at the front desk and learn that he is from [Kenya]. As you speak [Swahili], could you give a few short sentences expressing your gratitude for him choosing Swire Hotels before he departs?
